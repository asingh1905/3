# Q.3 Program to find number of pixels and resolution of a display screen

# input width and height
width = int(input("Enter screen width (in pixels): "))
height = int(input("Enter screen height (in pixels): "))

# total pixels = width * height
total_pixels = width * height

print("Resolution =", width, "x", height, "pixels")
print("Total number of pixels =", total_pixels)
